<h1> Quiz App </h1>

<h3> Google 'Google' </h3>

<p> I built an Android Quiz App for the Udacity Grow with Google Scholarship Challenge. 
I thought it would be fitting to design a quiz about Google as my topic of choice.
I take full ownership over the creative vision, planning, and development of the app. </p>
